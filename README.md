# Home Resident System
## Overview
This project is a JavaFX-based GUI application developed using Scene Builder (FXML). It is designed to enhance residential community security and convenience through two core functionalities: **Parking Pre-registration** and **Visitor Management**. The system includes role-based access for residents, security guards, and admin staff, enabling streamlined guest registration and visitor tracking.
